# credit_card_fraud_detection

## Description:
This machine learning project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses a dataset containing various features related to credit card transactions, including gender, education, marital status, and payment history. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent or not.

## Key Steps and Insights:

**1. Data Preparation:** The project begins with data loading and preprocessing, including dropping unnecessary columns and checking for missing values.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis:** Univariate analysis is conducted to understand the distribution of categorical variables such as gender, education, marital status, and default payment status. This helps in gaining insights into the dataset.

**3. Imbalance Visualization:** The project visualizes the class imbalance between default and non-default transactions to highlight the challenge of fraud detection.

**4. Model Building:** A Random Forest Classifier is employed to build a predictive model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

**5. Model Evaluation:** The project employs classification metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy to assess the model's performance on the test data.
